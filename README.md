# wirthian-langs

This project intends to collect the (E)BNF grammars of all the programming languages designed by Professor Niklaus Wirth, including further versions and implementation variants, as well as other somehow close or (highly subjectively) related languages.

## License

Since I will only transcribe what I can find elsewhere, the license for each grammar is the same as in the original work.

I will do my best to add the original source documents for each grammar. In this case, I'll state the original work's license in the header of the grammar.

If the original source is protected by copyright, I'll add the copyright notice in the header of the grammar, and add only the section or appendix containing the grammar, hoping that this is protected under fair use.
